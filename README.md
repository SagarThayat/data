Designed the project with a modular and reusable component structure.

Followed separation of concerns: UI components, pages, and assets are kept in separate folders.

Used React hooks for state management and lifecycle handling.

Focused on responsiveness to ensure the app works across devices.

Code is written with scalability in mind, so new features or components can be added easily.

Emphasis on clean UI/UX design for a better user experience.
